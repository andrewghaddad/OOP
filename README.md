# OOP

This is a compilation of all coursework done for a Information Technology class during my time at Rutgers University- New Brunswick. Within this class I learned the principles of object-oriented analysis, design and programming. The focus is on developing creative thinking for analyzing a problem domain and designing a solution, and on using the Python programming language.

Within this class, I was able to:
  - Apply critical thinking to analyze the requirements of a simple application and build a model ofthe problem.
  - Use the designated programming language to implement the designed solution.
  - Use object-oriented design principles to develop a conceptual solution.
  - Use visual programming tools to sketch and build simple user interfaces.
  - Apply testing and debugging to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the application.
